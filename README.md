A coding task that processes a binary data file containing 2 million entries, each representing the position of a vehicle. The aim is to determine the 10 closest vehicles to each of 10 predefined positions.

The challenge is to think of a more efficient way to achieve this and to implement it -- not just parallelising the brute force method of doing a total of 20 million distance calculations.
